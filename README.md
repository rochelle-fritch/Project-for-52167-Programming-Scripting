### Background & data summary

The Iris dataset was collected by Edgar Anderson to investigate the morphologic variation of three classes (species) of Irises in Gasp√© Peninsula (1). Fisher used this dataset in 1936 to discriminate between the classes (2). This multivariate data set records four variables of three classes of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, Iris Virginica). Each class of Iris has 50 replicates, giving a total of 150 samples in the dataset. Four flower variables, as well as Iris class were recorded. Here each row representas a sample and each column represents a variable measured (3):

1.	sepal length (cm)
2.	sepal width (cm)
3.	petal length (cm)
4.	petal width (cm)
5.	Iris class 

This dataset is frequently used as a demonstration dataset for teaching basic programming for data analytics and machine learning.
